I am not saying this plagarism checker is better than the one used by Professor Sorber, but there is evidence online 
that this one may be a little bit more accurate at detecting cheating. The detector determined low probability with
only a 9% local match. The 48% detected is refering to the functions sharing similar prototypes which was a mandatory
requirement from the project. The 48% is also due to the fact these prototypes were placed in a seperate file, so the 
match would be higher since there is only prototypes in the file

Here are some supporting articles. I tried to avoid biased articles
