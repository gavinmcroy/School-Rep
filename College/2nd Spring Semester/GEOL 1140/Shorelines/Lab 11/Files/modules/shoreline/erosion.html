<p align="center"><b>Erosion / Deposition Basics</b></p>
<p>Shorelines are under constant attack by waves, winds, and currents. The pounding 
force of waves, especially during storms, can be a powerful agent 
of mechanical weathering. The wave action can break, loosen, and 
abrade the shoreline materials. Currents do the work of erosion, 
transporting the broken materials away and depositing them in 
new locations.</p>
<p>These forces, working together, can have either a destructive 
or constructive effect on the shoreline. The destructive effect 
can be rapid and dramatic when the shoreline material is a sediment, 
such as sand, and much slower when the shoreline material is a 
durable bedrock. However, no natural material can completely resist 
the sustained attack of the waves and currents.</p></td>

<center><b>The Carrying Capacity of Water: Velocity, Erosion, and Deposition</b></center>
<p>A person interested in determining how a shoreline will respond to waves 
and currents needs to understand just one basic principle. This key 
principle is the relationship between current velocity and erosion. 
It can be stated as follows...</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" align="center" bgcolor="#ddffdd">
<tr> 
<td>&nbsp;Moving water will always attempt to carry as much sediment as its velocity allows.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p align="left">This principle can be illustrated with a simple example. Imagine a jar of 
still water with sediment (mud, sand, and small pebbles) on the bottom. 
If you insert a spoon and stir the water slowly some of the smaller 
sediment particles (the muds) will be picked up and carried by the moving 
water. If you stir faster the water velocity will increase and more 
mud will be picked up by the swirling waters. In addition, some of the 
sand grains will also be set into motion. If the speed of stirring is 
further increased then even more sand and mud will be picked up and 
carried and, if the speed is great enough, some of the small pebbles 
will be carried along too. This example demonstrates how faster currents 
have the ability to carry a larger volume of sediment and larger sediment 
particles than slower currents.</p>
<p align="left">Returning to our experiment. If the stirring is stopped the velocity of the water 
will begin to slow. This reduction in velocity will cause the pebbles 
to drop out of transport, followed by the sand grains and finally followed 
by the mud particles. This reduction in sediment load as the currents 
slow demonstrates how deposition occurs. This experiment clearly shows 
that water will carry as much sediment as its velocity allows.</p>
<p align="left">Two different erosion/deposition situations are possible. Both of these 
can be easily understood based upon the key principles of deposition 
and erosion explained above.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Longshore Current</b></p>
<p>The longshore current is a primary agent of shoreline erosion and 
deposition. Waves produced by sustained winds are driven up the 
beach at an angle to the shoreline. However, when the wave washes 
back down the beach it travels perpendicular to the shoreline. 
This results in a net movement of water along the beach known 
as the longshore current. Sand grains are transported in a similar 
pattern and the resulting sediment movement is known as longshore 
drift.</p></td>

<p align="center"><b>Case Study:<br>
Groin Construction</b></p>
<p>In areas where the longshore current is eroding, groins (rock or 
concrete structures built perpendicular to the shoreline) are 
sometimes built to slow the longshore current. The decreased current 
velocity on the up-current side of a groin results in deposition. 
However, as soon as the water moves past the groin it accelerates 
and immediately begins to erode the same amount of sediment that 
was dropped. Building groins to control an erosion problem usually 
just moves that problem a short distance down the beach.</p></td>

If the groins are close enough together the net result will be 
a growth in the width of the beach. However, if they are far apart 
then erosion will take place between the groins.<br>

<p align="center"><b>Case Study: Breakwaters</b></p>
<p>Breakwaters (rock or concrete structures built parallel to a beach and a short 
distance offshore) are sometimes built to protect a beach from 
waves or to provide a protected harbor for boats. Deposition usually 
occurs immediately behind a breakwater because it blocks the incoming 
waves, disrupting the longshore current. However, as soon as the 
longshore current moves beyond the breakwater it picks up velocity 
and erodes the same amount of sand that was dropped. Again, erosion 
was prevented in one area but increased in another.</p></td>

Breakwaters cause deposition by blocking waves and creating an area of still 
water between them and the shore. As the water moves downcurrent 
from the breakwater it erodes the same amount of sediment that 
was dropped.<br>
