Property Assessment</b></p>
<p>Shorelines are among the most dynamic places on our planet. Shorelines are 
places of constant change and in most locations either erosion 
or deposition is taking place through the actions of winds, waves, 
and currents. The rate of change is generally very slow, however, 
during severe storms the change can be dramatic, with tons of 
sediment being removed or deposited in just a few hours.</p>
<p>Shorelines are also locations that attract people. Their scenic 
beauty and recreational opportunities make them highly desirable 
for both year-round and vacation housing. However, the dynamic 
and sometimes violent nature of shorelines can make some of them 
risky locations for development. Examine the photo set at left 
to see how much change can happen in just one season of storms.</p></td>

Coastal States</b></p>
<p>The United States has thousands of miles of shoreline on the Atlantic 
Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean and Great Lakes. Through 
detailed study, areas that are subject to erosion can be recognized 
and mapped. The map at left shows that much of our coastline is 
severely eroding and most of it is at least moderately eroding.</p>
<p>Shoreline erosion is a significant problem and each year</font> 
it destroys or damages millions of dollars worth of property. 
However, those who are well informed about how erosion occurs 
and willing to research the history of a property can generally 
determine if it is at risk. These types of studies enable citizens 
and communities to avoid development or investment in risky areas, 
saving millions of dollars and possibly lives.</p></td>

<p align="center"><b>Your Job...</b></p>
<p>Hazard City is about 50 miles from the coast and many Hazard City residents 
enjoy visiting the beach. Many have purchased second homes, beachfront 
cottages, or timeshares. The most popular locations for these purchases 
are along the ocean beachfront and along the banks of the Clearwater 
River just upstream from where it enters the ocean. Care must 
be taken when purchasing properties in these areas because shoreline 
erosion can be a significant problem. Prudent buyers seek professional 
advice before they commit to such an important purchase.</p>
<p>You plan to visit the beach next weekend and a Hazard City real estate 
office has asked you to assess a few properties and report on 
how they might be affected by shoreline erosion. To be sure that 
you are ready for this job you decide to review the <a href="erosion.html">shoreline 
erosion</a>, <a href="budget.html">sediment budget</a>, <a href="streambank.html">streambank 
erosion</a> and </font><a href="assessment.html">site assessment</a> tutorials to brush up on your skills.</p></td>
