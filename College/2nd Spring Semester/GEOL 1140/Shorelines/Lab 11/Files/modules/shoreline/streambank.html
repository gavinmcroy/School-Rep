<p>In addition to erosion along the shorelines of oceans and lakes, 
erosion can also be a problem for streambank properties. The force 
of flowing water, especially during floods, can cause severe and 
rapid erosion. Streambank erosion can also be caused by wind-driven 
waves and boat wakes.</p>
<p>Efforts to protect the streambanks from erosion usually involve placing 
rip-rap on the streambanks. Rip-rap is a covering of rock placed 
on the streambank to protect it from erosion. To be effective, 
each piece of rock must be large enough that it will not be moved 
by the highest current velocity expected in that stream at that 
location.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Case Study: Stream Meanders</b></p>
<p align="left">Bends in the river are very common locations for erosion caused by stream 
currents. As water moves around the bend its velocity decreases 
on the inside of the bend and increases on the outside of the 
bend.</p>
<p align="left">The decrease in velocity on the inside of a bend causes the water 
to drop suspended sediments. This produces a sediment deposit 
known as a &quot;point bar&quot; on the inside of the river bend. 
The brown stippled areas on the map at right are point bar deposits.</p>
<p align="left">On the outside of a bend the velocity of water increases. This increase 
in speed gives the water an increased ability to pick up and carry 
sediment. As a result, erosion occurs.</p>
<p align="left">Over a long period of time, continued erosion on the outside of 
the bend and continued point bar building causes the stream channel 
to migrate across the landscape. This migration is known as &quot;meandering&quot; 
- a word selected for the seemingly slow and aimless movement 
of a stream back and forth across a flood plain.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Case Study: Island Migration</b></p>
<p align="left">Islands have a special appeal to many people and an island residence or 
cottage is often viewed as a novelty. 
However, developing real estate on an island has some of the same 
concerns as developing any shoreline property. An additional concern 
is that many islands in rivers (and on shorelines) are slowly 
moving features. They are frequently being eroded on the side 
facing the current and growing through deposition on the downcurrent 
side.</p>
<p align="left">An example of a slowly migrating island is Browns Island in the Ohio 
River between West Virginia and Ohio. Here the current of the 
Ohio River strikes the north end of the island and slowly erodes 
it. Deposition occurs on the south end of the island where the 
shoreline is protected from the current.</p>
<p align="left">Browns Island can be seen on the map at right. If you click on the &quot;enlargements&quot; 
link below the map, you will be able to see the purple photorevision 
ink that has been used to represent a shoreline position that 
is different from when the map was first published.</p>
<p align="left">Development on an island, especially on the upcurrent or downcurrent ends 
should be preceded by a study of historical maps or aerial photos. 
These can frequently reveal the rate and direction of migration 
that is occurring.</p>
