<td width="371" valign="top"><p align="center"><b>Sediment Budget</b></p>
<p>The &quot;sediment budget&quot; of a shoreline is the balance between 
sediment added to the coastal system and sediment removed from 
the coastal system. When more material is added than is removed, 
a surplus of sediment exists and the shoreline builds seaward 
through deposition. On the other hand, when more material is removed 
than is added, a deficit exists and the shoreline retreats landward 
through erosion.</p>
<p>Sediment can be added to the budget through the erosion of beaches 
or cliffs, streams dumping their load at the shoreline and currents 
transporting sediment in from other areas. Sometimes communities 
modify the sediment budget of a shoreline, removing sediment from 
areas of natural surplus and returning it to the shoreline where 
erosion is a problem. The goal is to maintain a stable shoreline 
so that current land uses can be preserved.</p>
<p>A map summarizing shoreline stability for the United States was 
shown in the &quot;Orientation.&quot; This map clearly conveyed 
that most US shorelines are unstable. People resist this instability 
with practices that sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully 
control the shoreline environment.</p></td>

<p align="center"><b>Case Study:<br>
Beach Nourishment</b></p>
<p align="left">In the last section we related the processes of erosion and deposition 
to the velocity of the water. This was an oversimplification because 
sediments added to or subtracted from the coastal system were 
not considered.</p>
<p align="left">We can visualize the results of sediment addition by returning to 
our jar experiment. If the water in the jar is being stirred and 
carrying a full load of sediment then dumping more sediment into 
the water will result in deposition. This is because moving water 
can only carry so much sediment. Adding more sediment will choke 
the system and deposition will occur.</p>
<p align="left">This gives us a third principle of shoreline erosion and deposition:</p>

<tr> 
<td><p>3) additions of sediment to the coastal system can cause deposition</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p align="left">Some coastal communities take advantage of this principle. If they 
have a shoreline erosion problem they simply dump sand into the 
coastal system. If the sand is added faster than the longshore 
current can carry it away then deposition will occur. Beaches 
down current from where the sand is added will grow seaward as 
an excess of sand is delivered and deposited. This is not a one-time 
effort because the growth, stability or erosion of the shoreline 
is now determined by the amount of sediment that people provide.</p>
<p align="left">These situations tie the sediment budget of the beach to the financial 
budget of the shoreline community. Stability is not guaranteed!</p></td>

<p align="center"><b>Case Study: Seawalls and Revetments</b></p>
<p>The opposite of beach nourishment is a subtraction of sediment from 
the coastal system. People can subtract sediment by dredging or 
by making it inaccessible to the forces of erosion. Building a 
seawall or a revetment (a cover of erosion resistant material placed on a shoreline for 
protection against strong waves or currents) reduce the sediment 
supply of a coastal system.</p>
<p>In these situations, erosion is reduced where the structure is built, 
however, the longshore current still has the same sediment carrying 
capacity. If it can not erode an adequate amount of sediment in 
the protected area it will try to pick up sediment in adjacent 
areas. The result is a decrease in the rate of erosion in one 
area and an increase in the rate of erosion in an adjacent area.
</p>
<p>This gives us a fourth principle of shoreline erosion and deposition;</p>

<p>These four principles can be used to better understand a variety of 
shoreline situations.</p>
