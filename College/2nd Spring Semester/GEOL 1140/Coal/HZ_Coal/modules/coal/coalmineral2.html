The value of coal <i>on the ground</i> is easy to assess; it is published in the Wall Street Journal, 
and can be viewed on a number of Web sites. Depending upon quality, it can 
sell for between $20 and $30 per ton. It is simply determined by how much 
the buyer is willing to pay, and the expenses incurred by the seller to produce 
and deliver it. However, the value of coal in the ground is a much trickier 
thing to determine. The price of coal <i>in the ground</i> depends upon four 
basic factors: 1) thickness of the seam, 2) quality of the coal, 3) location 
of the deposit, and 4) the ease of access to the property and seam.<br><br>
<b>Seam Thickness</b><br><br>
The thickness of a coal seam plays an important role in determining the value 
of a coal property. To start, the coal seam must be at least 24 inches thick 
to be considered for surface mining. It is not worth obtaining a permit, clearing 
the land, and then reclaiming, if the seam is of insignificant thickness. 
Beyond this limitation, thicker seams will always be more attractive than 
thin seams, all other factors being equal.<br><br>
In deep mining, there must be at least 30 inches of coal for equipment and 
people to be able to work in the mine. Seams below 30 inches in thickness 
will normally not be considered for mining. In general, the thicker the coal, 
the easier it will be to produce and make a profit.<br><br>
Finally, the coal must be free, or nearly free, of shale layers. Look at the 
continuous miner illustration and see how the mining height of the seam is 
confined to the thickest shale-free unit. Shale does not burn, it detracts 
from the heating value and results in excess ash left behind after the coal 
has burned. Seams that are free of shale layers are always the preference.<br><br>
<b>Coal Quality</b><br><br>
The best coals are low in sulfur and high in heating value. Low sulfur coals 
contain less than 1% sulfur. These coals are highly desirable and sell for 
a premium price. However, coals with sulfur contents over 3% are very difficult 
to sell. They require processing or emissions cleaning to be burned within 
the limits of government regulations. These general rules on sulfur content 
and coal value hold in just about any area where coal is produced.<br><br>
The heating value, or BTU content, of a coal depends mostly upon its rank, 
ranging from about 7200 BTU/pound for lignite, up to about 15500 BTU/pound 
for anthracite. Within an area as small as a couple of counties, the range 
of heading values to be found is generally quite limited. This is because 
the factors that determine the rank of a coal are generally regional in scale.<br><br>
<b>Location of the Deposit</b><br><br>
The best location for a coal mine is right next to the facility that will 
burn the coal. This eliminates transportation charges, which can be significant 
when hauling a bulk commodity like coal. In general, the closer the coal property 
is to the coal consumer, the greater the value of that property.<br><br>
A second factor about location is also important. That is the type of transportation 
that is available between the coal property and the coal consumer. The least 
expensive means of transportation is by barge on a navigable river. Railroad 
transportation is slightly more expensive than barge transportation, and truck 
transportation is the most expensive of all.<br><br>
All other factors being equal, a coal property with a transportation advantage 
over competing producers will always command a premium price. However, even 
if barge or rail transportation is available, they will not be important considerations 
if the coal consumer does not have access to them.<br><br>
<b>Ease of Access</b><br><br>
How easily a coal property can be reached and developed is very important 
in determining its value. Properties that are near paved roads, on flat land, 
and where the seam is shallow are easy to access. Remote locations, steep 
terrain, and extremely deep seams are the most difficult and expensive to 
develop.<br><br>
<b>Royalty Rates</b><br><br>
A royalty is an amount of money that is paid to the owner of something important 
by another party who will develop and sell that important item. As examples: 
publishers pay authors royalties for the right to print and sell books, music 
companies pay musicians royalties for the right to produce and sell CDs, and 
coal companies pay royalties to people who allow them to produce and sell 
their coal. Authors are paid a royalty for each book that is sold, musicians 
are paid a royalty for each CD that is sold, and land owners are paid a royalty 
for each ton of coal that is sold.<br><br>
The amount paid per ton of coal generally ranges from $0.50 to $3.00. The 
exact amount depends upon the four factors discussed above: seam thickness, 
coal quality, location of the deposit, and ease of access. A property with 
a shallow, six-foot thick coal seam, containing high quality coal that is 
close to markets and easy to access, might receive a royalty of $3.00. Royalties 
of $0.50 are paid for those properties with deep coal seams of marginal thickness, 
containing lower quality coals, and located significant distances from coal 
consumers. Royalties of $0.50, or even less, are also paid for coal properties 
that are owned by foolish people. These people failed to research the potential 
value of their property, or to get expert advice on how much their property 
is truly worth.</p>
