Title 
30: Environmental Quality<br>
Part 1: Environmental Protection Commission<br>
Chapter 330: Municipal Solid Waste</font><br><br>
Rule &sect;330.1: Declaration and Intent:</b><br><br>
<b>(a)</b> The regulations in this chapter cover all aspects of municipal 
solid waste management under the authority of the State Water Commission and 
are based primarily on the stated purpose of State Civil Statutes, Health 
and Safety Code, Chapter 361, as amended, hereafter referred to as the State 
Solid Waste Disposal Act. The owner or operator of a municipal solid waste 
landfill (MSWLF) facility shall comply with any other applicable federal rules, 
laws, regulations, or other requirements.<br><br>
<b>(b)</b> All permits shall remain in force after October 9, 1993, the effective 
date of this chapter. To the extent that a standard has been changed by this 
chapter, the permittee may continue to operate under standards contained in 
previously issued permits, except for those requirements mandated by EPA 40 
Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 257 and 258, as amended, which implement 
certain requirements of Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA). For those federally mandated requirements, the permittee is under 
an obligation to apply for a change to his permit in accordance with &sect;305.62 
of this title (relating to Amendment) or &sect;305.70 of this title (relating 
to Municipal Solid Waste Permit Modification), as applicable, to incorporate 
the required standard. The application shall be submitted no later than April 
9, 1994. Timely submission of a request for a permit change qualifies the 
owners or operators of existing MSWLF units for interim status. MSWLF facility 
owners or operators with interim status are treated as having been issued 
a permit modification or amendment until the executive director makes a final 
determination on the permit modification request or the commission makes a 
final determination on the permit amendment request. Facility owners or operators 
with interim status must comply with the requirements of this chapter upon 
the effective date of this chapter.<br><br>
<b>(c)</b> A permit or license shall be required for each MSW unit, and the 
executive director, at her discretion, may include one or more different types 
of units in a single permit if the units are located at the same facility.<br><br>
<b>Rule &sect;330.2: Types of Municipal Solid Waste Sites:</b><br><br>
<b>(a)</b> Classification of municipal solid waste facilities (MSWLF). The 
commission has classified all municipal solid waste facilities according to 
the method of processing or disposal of municipal solid waste.<br><br>
<b>(b)</b> Municipal solid waste facility-Type I. A Type I facility shall 
be considered to be the standard landfill for the disposal of municipal solid 
waste. All solid waste deposited in a Type I facility shall be compacted and 
covered at least daily. The commission may authorize the designation of special-use 
areas for processing, storage, and disposal or any other functions involving 
solid waste.<br><br>
<b>(c) </b>Municipal solid waste facility-Type II. For the purpose of this 
section, a Type II facility is defined as: a facility or operation serving 
less than 5,000 persons or the population equivalent; receiving less than 
12 1/2 tons of solid waste per day; compacted and covered on a frequency that 
will not result in any significant health problems; and operation not conducted 
within 300 yards of a public road.<br><br>
<b>(d)</b> Municipal solid waste facility-Type III. For the purpose of this 
section, a Type III facility is defined as: a facility or operation serving 
less than 1,500 persons or the population equivalent; receiving less than 
3 3/4 tons of waste per day; and operation not conducted within 300 yards 
of a public road.<br><br>
<b>(e)</b> Municipal solid waste facility-Type IV. A Type IV facility or operation 
may be authorized by the commission for the disposal of brush, construction-demolition 
waste, and/or rubbish that are free of putrescible and free of household wastes. 
A Type IV operation shall not be operated within 300 yards of a public road 
unless the executive director, after a site evaluation, determines that the 
proposed operation in the proposed location is acceptable.<br>
<b><br>
(f)</b> Municipal solid waste facility-Type V. Separate solid waste processing 
facilities are classified as Type V. These facilities shall encompass processing 
plants that transfer, incinerate, shred, grind, bale, compost, salvage, separate, 
dewater, reclaim, and/or provide other processing of solid waste.<br><br>
<b>(g)</b> Municipal solid waste facility-Type VI. A Type VI facility or operation 
may be authorized by the commission for a facility involving a new or unproven 
method of managing or utilizing municipal solid waste, including resource 
and energy recovery projects. The commission may limit the size of these facilities 
until the method is proven.<br><br>
<b>(h) </b>Municipal solid waste facility-Type VII. A Type VII facility or 
operation may be authorized by the commission for the land management of sludges 
and/or similar wastes.<br><br>
<b>(i)</b> Municipal solid waste facility-Type VIII. Facilities for the management 
of used or scrap tires are classified as Type VIII.<br><br>
<b>(j) </b>Municipal solid waste facility-Type IX. A closed disposal facility, 
an inactive portion of a disposal facility, or an active disposal facility, 
used for extracting materials for energy and material recovery or for gas 
recovery for beneficial use is classified as Type IX.<br><br>
<b>Rule &sect;330.3: Site Characterization:</b><br><br>
<b>(a)</b> The application shall describe the existing conditions and character 
of the site and surrounding area.<br><br>
<b>(b)</b> Application Requirements:.<br><br>

of the site boundary. Drainage, pipeline, and utility easements within the 
site shall be shown. Access roads serving the site shall also be shown.<br><br>
<b>(8)</b> Land use. A primary concern is that the use of any land for a municipal 
solid waste site not adversely impact human health or the environment. The
