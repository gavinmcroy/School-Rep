  storyText: 'The storms impact was utterly catastrophic. The castle was nearly flattened
    and you sit within a pile of rubble looking onward of a once great kingdom. You
    realized it was never your job as a ruler to be liked. But instead it was your
    job to lead the people and make the best choices for them even if they couldn''t
    see the benefit of your actions. It dawns upon you what it means to be a truly
    great king
