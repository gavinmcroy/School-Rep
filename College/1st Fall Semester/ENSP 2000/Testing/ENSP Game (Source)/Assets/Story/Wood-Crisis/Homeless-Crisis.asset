  storyText: 'People are incredibly upset. There has been a spike in homelessness
    in the past few months since the announcement. It seems only the rich are living
    in homes these days. People are beginning to question the integrity of the rich.
    You as well get a phone call from an advisor stating there is odd climate behavior.
    Pressure changes occurring for no immediate reason.

    What do you do?


    1. Focus all efforts on building homes


    2. Devote remaining resources to investigating the odd pressure change'
