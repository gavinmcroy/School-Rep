  storyText: 'You follow the plan as a normal procedure. But even you begin to worry
    about the damages to climate. It''s been a few years since your advisors pleaded
    change, and you''ve noticed increased winds. Yet you are faced with another problem.
    Increasing the population has increased the need for homes. Wood demand is through
    the roof, and to compensate, your advisors are recommending you begin harvesting.
    You fear consequences for this action

    What do you do?


    1. Follow your duty as a king and begin harvesting lumber and building homes
