  storyText: 'The storm is expected to make landfall in about 13 hours. Within that
    time, you are rushing from meeting to meeting, trying to resolve the matter. People
    are beginning to get worried as the rumor is spreading about the scale of this
    storm. You meet with researcher after researcher and confirm the storm was caused
    by a substantial loss in trees which resulted in a noticeable increase in world
    temperature and as a result a considerable rise in storm power

    What do you do?


    1. Hold on and hope for the best'
