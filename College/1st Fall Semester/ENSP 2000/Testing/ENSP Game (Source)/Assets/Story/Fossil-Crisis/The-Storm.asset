  storyText: 'It''s been over a few months, and you and your council are about to
    initiate the green phase. But you get a call from a distraught researcher. You''ve
    never met him nor heard of him, but he is imploring there is soon to be the formation
    of a mega cell storm due to implications of greenhouse gasses from fossil fuels.
    Your advisors warn that he is the boy who cried wolf and is not one to listen
    too. They assure you their data shows no correlation to increased storm strength

    What do you do?


    1. Ignore the phone call and proceed with the plan


    2. Consider his warning and bring him to the council meeting'
