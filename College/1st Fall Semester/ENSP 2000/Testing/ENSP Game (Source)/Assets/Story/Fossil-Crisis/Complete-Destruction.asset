  storyText: "The storm was utterly devastating. With all efforts, the people united
    under the emergency call. Everyone worked together, sandbagging homes, and preparing
    for the absolute worst. It was a time of harmony. But when the storm arrived,
    it completely laid waste to the kingdom and brought it down towards its knees.
    Scavengers begin invading, and with all services gone, your kingdom collapses.
    You sit in a disappointment of defeat. \nWhat do you do?\n\n1. As with any captain,
    go down with the sinking ship"
