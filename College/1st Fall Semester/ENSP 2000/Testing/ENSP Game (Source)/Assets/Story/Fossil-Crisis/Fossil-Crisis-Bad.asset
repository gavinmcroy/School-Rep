  storyText: 'People are incredibly angry. Data poles show an exponentially decrease
    in likability towards the kingdom. Banning fossil fuels has made transitting between
    different locations nearly undoable. Many transit systems were dependent on fossil
    fuels, and the markets are beginning to go downward

    What do you do?


    1. Reintroduce fossil fuels


    2. Make a public announcement for why fossil fuels cannot be allowed back'
