The program should work with no problem. Type make run and it will pass the required command line arguments automatically. There is another file called MonthInfo that is essential for the program to run. It reduces the difficulty of checking month days by having all the information about a month and its days in a separate file.
I was also unsure if we were supposed to allow the user to specify what output via command line
so I hard coded in PrintBDay Inside Main on line 21

1. problems you encountered with this assignment:
	- I didn't encounter to many problems as I have made a few linked lists before. Probably the 			 hardest part for me was getting scanset to work but I figured it out with tinkering	

2. how you solved the problems:
	- Most of the minor problems I ran into were solved through tinkering and playing around to see if what I thought was causing the problem or if its something else

3. your thoughts about the assignment: 
	- I thought it was a good assignment. I had a little bit of difficulty in the beginning making the code work based on the prototypes provided but once I understood there general setup and purpose I didn't find it too difficult
