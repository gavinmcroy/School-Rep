# GPU Sorting Algorithms in OpenCL

This is the result of a freestyle assignment for a GPU-Computing class at KIT in Summer 2016.
Some of the source code (mostly the common code folder) was provided.
I coded the sorting algorithms mergesort, bitonic mergesort and a bubble sort sorting network for OpenCL-
Also there is a implementation of mergesort on CPU for comparison.
See [Sort.cl](Code/Sort.cl) for Kernel-Code, [CSortTask.cpp](Code/CSortTask.cpp) for most of the host code and [CSortingMain.cpp](Code/CSortingMain.cpp) for changing local work size and array size.


## Standard Mergesort for GPU
Mostly not recommended because it does not benefit that well from parallelization. With bigger array size the graphics card will eventually run out of memory.

## Bubble Sort Sorting Network
Called Simple Sorting Network (SSN) in Code. Not recommended because it is inefficient and slow.

## Bitonic Mergesort
Recommended sorting variant of these three. Is fast and benefits well from parallelization.


## How to Build
Best way is to use cmake with the [Code](Code/) folder as source folder. Use a 64-Bit compiler as otherwise bigger array sizes won't work.

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```

## Measurements
All measurements with randomly generated arrays of the given size. Times are in milliseconds. The CPU variant for comparison is a self written mergesort implementation that generally runs faster than std::sort.
