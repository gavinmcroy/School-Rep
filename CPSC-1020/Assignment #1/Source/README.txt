The way this works is that it looks for 4 image files by the following names
"chips.pgm"
"chips.ppm"
"potatochips.pgm"
"potatochips.ppm"

It does take a bit of time to copy the ASCII color and gray image so it may seem like its hanging when its not 

To run it just type "make run" and it'll do everything on its own. Images copied will start with the letter T
