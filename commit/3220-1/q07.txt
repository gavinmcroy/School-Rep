I have a system that uses segmentation, uses 16-bit logical addresses and 16-bit physical addresses and allows each process can have up to 8 memory segments. 

Assume that a process has the following segment table...


Index   Start       Segment Size
0       0x0020      0x030
1       --          ---  //unused
2       0x0005      0x012
3       0x0100      0x100
4       --          ---  //unused  
5       0x02a0      0x01f
6       0x0300      0x100
7       0xff00      0x0ff


...and that it wants to perform three data writes (20 bytes each) starting at logical addresses 0x010a, 0x4010, and 0xa009.

1. Which segments do these addresses map to? In order: 0 - 2 - 5

2. What are the physical addresses? In order: 0x12A - 0x015 - 0x02A9

3. Will the writes succeed? (why or why not?) In order: Works offset is bigger than segment size - No runs out b/c it performs three data writes - Yes, enough for segment size and data writes
